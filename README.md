# **Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project**

This repository is for the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.  

## Summary

The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.  The data used for this project is from a study on Human Activity Using Smartphones.  The original data can be found:

Using the "Run_analysis.R" script against this data will do the following:

1. Merge the training and test datasets.
2. Extract the Standard Deviation and Mean for each measurement.
3. Provide descriptive names to name activities in the data set.
4. Provide descriptive variable names.
5. Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additonally a [codebook](https://github.com/calicea30/gettingandcleaningdata/blob/main/codebook.md) has been created to describe the variables, the data and work performed during the cleaning the data.
